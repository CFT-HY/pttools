PTtools is a library of python functions for calculating hydrodynamical quantities 
around expanding bubbles of the new phase in an early universe phase transition.

Master branch:

bubble contains main branch of code for computing invariant profiles, plus scripts to make plots

gw\_code contains code from taking invariant profile and computing GW power spectrum (Mulham)

dev branch:

code\_bits contains code from various projects in progress
* plot_v_ln_T returns graphs showing fluid velocity, temperature and enthalpy around wall.
* plot_thermo shows comparison graphs between the Bag and EIKR models.
* Bag_Toolbox and EIKR_Toolbox contain thermodynamic equations for the respective models.
* Mechanics_Toolbox contains relativistic equations and other shared equations.
* Plus other bits and pieces

Known issues: Small discrepancies between this program and Mark's original version for Bag model.
Epsilon and alpha_plus negative for all T.
