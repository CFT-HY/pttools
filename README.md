PTtools is a library of python functions for calculating hydrodynamical quantities 
around expanding bubbles of the new phase in an early universe phase transition, 
and the resulting gravitational wave power spectrum in the sound shell model.

Reference: [Hindmarsh and Hijazi (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10040)

### submodules:

* bubble: code for computing the fluid shells (velocity and enthalpy as a function of scaled radius), plus scripts to make plots.
* gw\_code: code from taking fluid shells and computing GW power spectrum.

### branches:

* master: main branch, stable release.
* master_dev: developments for later inclusion in the master branch.
* bubble_dev: for developments in the hydro part of the code only.
